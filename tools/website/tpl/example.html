        I'm a hands-on, qualified programmer with over 15 years experience envisioning, developing and implementing applications, games, synthesizers, websites, language processors, 3D engines, UI libraries for Windows/Linux/Mac, as well as for Android, iOS and web.
        <hr>
        My latest passion is a functional approach to development. I also know a lot about code refactoring (yes, Martin Fowler is my hero!), Agile approach helped me and the teams I collaborated with during the year of my work. I am a big fan of extreme programming as well.
        <hr>
        I am a convinced advocate for very strict and structured programming. Even in JavaScript I always annotate functions with Google Closure comments and run everything through Facebook Flow JS.

    <div class="panel-heading">History</div>
    <div class="panel-body" align="justify">
        My journey began when I was 11 years old: somehow I managed to put my hands on a old Intel 80386 PC (a very rare computer in USSR back then) and a book, called “C programming language”, written by Kernighan and Ritchie, which I learned in 3 months. That summer was the most fascinating time in my childhood.
        Learning C was an excellent opportunity finally to stop spending all my pocket money playing arcade coin-op machines and to start developing games myself! Little did I know that the programming itself will become the most interesting game I have ever played in my life.
        My first game was a remake of a legendary arcade "River Rand" by Atari.
        The rest is just history.

        <div class="info">
            In this company I was responsible for development of a multimedia SCORM course generator, which allows methodologists, teachers and screenwriters to create or generate multimedia e-learning solutions for 3rd party companies. The generator is called "Scroller" and intensively used in "ActiveLerning" nowadays. The backend is written in Haxe and it generates hardcoded Flash courses for any LMS that supports either SCORM 1.2 or SCORM 2004 format.
