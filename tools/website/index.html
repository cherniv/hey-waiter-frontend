			<issue>
				<margin>-.4</margin>
				When it comes to today’s restaurant businesses, it’s safe to say that the experience that you offer your guests
				is
				almost exclusively reliant on the level of service that your waiters can offer. Even when a meal is subpar, the
				experience, the atmosphere, and the service that your waiters provide can turn things around.
				Long gone are the days in which restaurant owners are faced with the high price tag of a buzzer-based waiter
				call
				system – or worse, no waiter call system at all! Today, you can embrace technology with a completely free waiter
				call system designed to enhance your restaurant service like never before.

				Waiter.Live is a simple, easy to use restaurant service optimization platform specifically designed to make it
				easier for your guests to call a waiter over to their table without having To simply wait for their waiter to
				walk by or to rely on an outdated buzzer system.
				<br>

				Waiter.Live uses a unique QR code that restaurant owners can print out on their own and place on each of their
				tables entirely free of charge. From there, your guests can use the built-in QR code reader found on their
				smartphone to scan the unique code and instantly call a waiter over to their table – all without the need for
				fancy, expensive buzzer and pager systems!

				of advertising. Just imagine: your <b>every</b> client scans the QR code to call a waiter and now he is <b>only
				one
				click away from your Instagram</b>.

				We’ll generate the code, and you can focus on the design! Make your QR code look just how you want it to, so
				that when your guests see it on top of their table, they know exactly what to do. Take a look at some of the
				examples down below to see just how you can customize your QR code.
